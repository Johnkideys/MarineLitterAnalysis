# MarineLitterAnalysis
Pan-European organisations, communities, NGOs and citizens have collected valuable data on beach litter within the framework 
of the European Environment Agency's (EEA) Marine Litter Watch (MLW) program.  
The data was collected via a mobile app.
The publicly available data from the 2013-2020 period is accessible at the EEA site ( https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/marine-litter ).
In this analysis, I have re-analysed the data to support/confirm Prof. A.E. Kideysâ€™s Excel work,  using Python.  

Main Insights:  
* Litter counts were increasing until 2017 after which a decreased trend was observed at the European level.  
* The most polluted sea in Europe was the Black Sea.  
* The most occuring litter items were cigarette butts/filters, plastic pieces, plastic caps/drink lids.
