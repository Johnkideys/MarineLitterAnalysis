# MarineLitterAnalysis
Pan-European organisations, communities, NGOs and citizens have collected valuable data on beach litter within the framework 
of the European Environment Agency's (EEA) Marine Litter Watch (MLW) program. The data was collected via a mobile app.
The publicly available data from the 2013-2020 period is accessible at the EEA site ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/coast_sea/marine-litterwatch ).
In this analysis, I have re-analysed the data to support/confirm Prof. A.E. Kideysâ€™s Excel work,  using Python.
